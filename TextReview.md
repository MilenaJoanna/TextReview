# Do's and don'ts if an SME doesn't give the information

Every technical writer communicates with different people to get the needed information to work correctly. Very often they reach out to the so-called SME-s to know more about a topic. 

SME means "Subject Matter Expert". It is a person who knows a lot about a specific topic. Some of the SME-s give information willingly, some don't. **Here is what to do (and what not) if SME doesn't give information**

## Appreciate
Appreciate the efforts of the SME who you ask for information. **Say thank you.**

## Be concrete
**Prepare yourself** before you ask questions. 

## Communicate correctly
**Communicate correctly** You have to communicate with different people and different SME-s. Always adjust how you speak to this specific SME.  

## Don't expect too much
**Don't expect too much.** Be satisfied with what you get. Show gratitude.

## Escalate only when needed
**Don't escalate the issue too quickly.** Sometimes SME-s cannot answer your questions. They may for example be busy and not have time.

## Fun
**Don't be serious all the time.** Sometimes you can tell a joke or have fun with an SME. 

## Give, don't just take
**Give something to the expert as well.** Buy them a coffee or treat them to a lunch. You can as well exchange your knowledge.

## Human
**Treat an SME like a human.** Everybody is just a human and can have problems which can influence their behavior. 

## Initiate
**Be proactive.** It is you who has to come to the SME first if you want that they help you with something.

## Just continue
**Just continue your work.** When you ask questions and the SME doesn't answer - use your logic to finish the task. Escalate the issue when you really have to. 

## Keep it simple 
**Tell the SME what you need.** Be precise.

## Listen
**Listen carefully to what the SME says.** Make notes or even record your conversation so that you can have the material when you need it.

## Motivation
**Don't lose your motivation.** When you don't see any progress in communication and cooperation with an SME - you need to change your approach.

## Network
**Start the contact with an SME before you need something from them.** Treat contacts with an expert as an investment.
  
## Options
**Give the SME options to choose from.** Ask them which cooperation option they prefer.

## Positive attitude
**Smile. Have a positive attitude.** Don't complain.  

## Questions
**Ask the right questions** Sometimes the right questions are better than many questions.

## Repeat
**Remind the SME about yourself and your issue.** Sometimes you need to contact the SME more than once. SME-s can be very busy and they can forget your messages.  

## Set the cooperation rules
**Set the cooperation rules between you and the SME** Specify if you communicate verbally or in writing. How often? How much time per week/month? It gives more structure into your teamwork.

## Tribal knowledge
**Document the useful knowledge that is not documented yet.** For those of you who don't know - **tribal knowledge** means there is knowledge within an organization that is not documented anywhere - it exists only in the minds of the people who know something about an issue, a process etc. This isn’t a good thing, especially in big structures, like international companies. If you ask SME-s about things - you play a very important role and can help also other people.

## User
**Remember that you represent the end user.** Technical writers are sometimes called **user advocates.** This is because even the best documentation cannot replace bad design. Be ready to represent the end user and their problems. Sometimes it can mean to meet with an expert who is not responsive.

## Visibility
**Be visible in your workplace.** When people know you and know what you do, you get help quicker.

## Why behind something 
**Tell the SME why you need something from them.** Many SME-s are more cooperative when they know why somebody needs information.  

## X-factor
**Invest in your social skills. Try to improve them everyday** They can be your X-factor which makes you very special.  

## “You have to”
**Be direct but don't be arrogant.** Don't tell the SME "You have to do this" because in most cases it is not polite.  

## Zest
**Be enthusiastic. Enthusiasm and engagement are always positive.** A person who likes what they do, really inspires and other people want to cooperate with them. Be such a person.
