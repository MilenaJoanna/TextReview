# An ABC list what to do if SME doesn't give the information

Every technical writer communicates with different people to get the needed information to work correctly. Very often they reach out to the SME-s to know more about a topic. 

SME means "Subject Matter Expert". It is a person who knows a lot about a topic. Some of the SME-s give information, some not. **Here is what to do if SME doesn't give information**

## A - Appreciate
Appreciate the SME you ask for information. **Say thank you.**

## B - Be concrete
**Prepare yourself** before you ask questions. 

## C - Communicate correctly
You have to **communicate with different SME-s**.
Always adjust how you speak to this specific SME.  

## D - Don't expect too much
Don't have too many expectations. Be satisfied with what you get.

## E - Escalate only when needed
Don't escalate the issue too quickly. Sometimes SME-s cannot answer your questions.  

## F - Fun
**You don't have to be serious all the time.** Sometimes you can tell a joke or have fun with an SME.  

## G - Give
**Give something. Exchange your knowledge.** You can also help the SME. 

## H - Human
**Treat an SME like a human.** They may have a bad day, be tired or have other problems which can influence their behavior. Don‚Äôt worry. 

## I - Initiate
**You need to be proactive.** You have to ask the SME first. 

## J - Just continue
**Just continue your work.** When you ask questions and the SME doesn't answer - use your logic to finish the task. Escalate the issue when you really have to. 

## K - Keep it simple 
**Tell the SME what you need** Be precise.

## L - Listen
**Listen carefully to what the SME is saying.** Make notes or even record your conversation so that you can have the material when you need it.

## M - Motivation
**Don't lose your motivation.** When you don't see any progress in communication and cooperation with an SME - you need to change your approach.

## N - Network
**Start the contact with an SME before you need something from them.**  

## O - Options
**Give the SME options to choose from.** Ask them which option they prefer.

## P - Positive attitude
**Smile. Have a positive attitude.** Don't complain.  

## Q - Questions
**Ask the right questions** Sometimes the right questions are better than many questions.

## R - Repeat
**Remind the SME about yourself and your issue.** Sometimes you need to ping the SME more than once. SME-s tend to be very busy and they may overlook your messages.  

## S - Set the cooperation rules
Especially if you know that you will regularly cooperate with the SME it‚Äôs worth to **establish some rules on how the cooperation will look like.** Will you communicate verbally or in writing? How often? How much time per week/month? It will definitely put more structure into your teamwork.

## T like... Tribal knowledge
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term - **tribal knowledge** describes a situation in which there is knowledge within an organization that is not documented anywhere and exists only in the minds of the people who know something about an issue, a process etc. This isn‚Äôt a desirable phenomenon, especially within big structures, like international companies. By reaching out to SME-s and asking questions, **you play an important role in taking this useful knowledge to light**, so let that be your motivation to **be persistent** while dealing with an unresponsive SME.

## U like... User
Technical writers are also sometimes referred to as **user advocates.** This is because even the best documentation cannot make up for a bad, unintuitive design. Keep in mind that representing the user and their issues may sometimes mean to handle an uncooperative SME as well üòâ

## V like‚Ä¶ Visibility
Visibility can be a powerful tool in a company. **When people know you and what you are doing, you are more likely to receive the needed support.** I personally have had a few situations in which I was able to gain the information I needed mainly because the person I turned to knew me from my other projects.

## W like... Why behind something 
Many SME-s seem to be much more cooperative when they **see the why behind** things. A short explanation of what do you need the information for and how it fits into a bigger picture work well at least with certain types of SME-s.

## X like... X-factor
The X factor understood as a **quality that you cannot describe that makes someone very special** may be a game changer as well. It sometimes goes hand in hand with someone‚Äôs visibility. The X factor may be also someone's very **well developed personal and social skills** so it‚Äôs definitely worth to polish them on an everyday basis.

## Y like... ‚ÄúYou have to‚Äù
For me personally one of the most annoying type of people coming to get something from me were the ones who started their talk with ‚Äúyou have to‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou have to tell me xyz because you are an SME.‚Äù Or even ‚Äúyou have to prepare this‚Äù without any explanation and with no idea what they actually wanted. **Don't confuse being direct with being arrogant.** Don't go this way.

## Z like... Zest
Whoever you work with, **enthusiasm and engagement will always stand out positively.** A person who is genuinely committed to what they do, truly inspires and other people want to cooperate with them. The zest and energy with which you approach your daily tasks, shines through, making you confidently pursue your goals.
